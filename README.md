# Leaderboard Project

Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions are exciting events where teams compete by solving security challenges. The Leaderboard project acts as the heart of a CTF, allowing organizers to manage challenges, track team scores in real-time, and provide transparency to participants. This project is designed for both CTF organizers and participants to enhance the competition experience.

## Features

- Real-time leaderboard updates.
- User authentication and session management.
- Score submission and verification system.
- Easy-to-use admin interface for managing challenges and teams.
- Built-in security to prevent cheating or unauthorized score submissions.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: A high-level Python Web framework.
- **Channels**: Enables handling WebSockets for real-time leaderboard updates.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and real-time communication.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Github Actions CI/CD**: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

## Installation

You can easily run the Leaderboard project using Docker or Docker Compose. The project has been containerized and is available as an image on Docker Hub.

### Option 1: Using Docker

1. **Pull the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker pull tachyonbyte/leaderboard:latest
   ```

   Docker Hub link: [tachyonbyte/leaderboard](https://hub.docker.com/r/tachyonbyte/leaderboard)

2. **Run the container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 80:80 tachyonbyte/leaderboard:latest 
   ```

3. **Implement persistence with volume mount (optional):**

   To ensure data persistence, you can mount a volume for the SQLite database:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 80:80 --mount source=sqlite-db,target=/app/ctf/ tachyonbyte/leaderboard:latest
   ```

   This command mounts the local `sqlite-db` volume to the containerâ€™s `/app/ctf/` directory, where the database is stored.

4. **Access the leaderboard:**  
   Visit `http://localhost` in your browser. use email "admin@admin.com" and password "tulakaymahit"

### Option 2: Using Docker Compose

Follow these steps to set up the Leaderboard project using Docker Compose:

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**

   ```yaml
  services:
   app:
      depends_on:
         - redis
      image: tachyonbyte/leaderboard:latest
      ports:
         - "80:80"
      volumes:
         - sqlite-db:/app/ctf/ctf/db.sqlite3

   redis:
      image: redis:alpine

  volumes:
    sqlite-db:
      driver: local
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Compose setup:**

   Navigate to the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is saved and run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will pull the necessary Docker image, create the required containers, and run the application.

3. **Access the leaderboard:**  
   Visit `http://localhost` in your browser.

4. **Stop the application (when needed):**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

This method simplifies running the application and managing dependencies through a single command.

## Usage

- Access the leaderboard and manage teams and challenges via the provided interface.
- Submit scores and track rankings in real-time.
